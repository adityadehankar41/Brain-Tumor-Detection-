        <h1>Advanced Brain Tumor Treatment Technologies</h1>
        <p>Innovative approaches for better patient outcomes</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p> Department of Neurosurgery is at the forefront of implementing cutting-edge technologies for brain tumor treatment. These innovative approaches aim to improve patient outcomes through less invasive procedures and more precise interventions.</p>

        <h2>Key Treatment Technologies</h2>

        <div class="technology">
            <h3>Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)</h3>
            <p>A minimally invasive procedure that uses laser energy delivered through a small incision to heat and destroy tumor tissue. Our Clinic was an early adopter of this technology, which can be used for hard-to-reach tumors.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="technology">
            <h3>Intraoperative MRI</h3>
            <p>Allows surgeons to capture real-time MRI images during surgery, enabling more complete tumor removal while preserving healthy tissue. This technology helps confirm the extent of tumor removal before completing the procedure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technology">
            <h3>Advanced Imaging Techniques</h3>
            <p>We utilizes several advanced imaging technologies including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Functional MRI (fMRI): Maps brain activity to help surgeons avoid critical areas</li>
                <li>Diffusion tensor imaging: Visualizes white matter tracts to guide surgical approaches</li>
                <li>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Analyzes biochemical changes in tumors</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="technology">
            <h3>Awake Brain Surgery</h3>
            <p>Performed while the patient is conscious but sedated, allowing surgeons to monitor brain function in real-time during tumor removal. This approach helps preserve critical functions like speech and motor skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technology">
            <h3>Robotic-Assisted Surgery</h3>
            <p>Enhances surgical precision through robotic systems that assist neurosurgeons in performing complex procedures with greater accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of These Technologies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced invasiveness compared to traditional open surgery</li>
            <li>Shorter hospital stays and recovery times</li>
            <li>Improved accuracy in tumor targeting</li>
            <li>Better preservation of healthy brain tissue</li>
            <li>Reduced risk of complications</li>
            <li>Improved quality of life outcomes for patients</li>
        </ul>
