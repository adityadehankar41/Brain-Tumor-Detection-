        <h2>What Are Pituitary Tumors?</h2>
        <p>Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign) growths that remain in the pituitary gland or surrounding tissues. These tumors are relatively common in adults, and many don't cause symptoms or require treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland situated at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. Despite its small size (about the size of a pea), the pituitary gland is called the "master gland" because it produces hormones that control many other endocrine glands in your body.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms & Signs</h2>
        <p>Symptoms of pituitary tumors vary depending on whether they are functioning (hormone-producing) or nonfunctioning tumors, as well as which hormones they affect:</p>

                <h3>General Symptoms (Due to Tumor Growth)</h3>
                <ul class="symptom-list">
                    <li><strong>Headaches</strong> - Often severe and persistent</li>
                    <li><strong>Vision problems</strong> - Including loss of peripheral vision or double vision</li>
                    <li><strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Confusion</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Dizziness</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of consciousness</strong> (rare)</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Hormone-Related Symptoms</h3>
                <ul class="symptom-list">
                    <li><strong>Overproduction of growth hormone</strong>: Acromegaly (gigantism in children), enlarged hands and feet, coarsened facial features</li>
                    <li><strong>Overproduction of prolactin</strong>: Irregular menstrual periods, milk production in women not nursing (galactorrhea), erectile dysfunction in men</li>
                    <li><strong>Overproduction of ACTH</strong>: Cushing's syndrome - weight gain, easy bruising, muscle weakness, diabetes, high blood pressure</li>
                    <li><strong>Underproduction of hormones</strong>: Fatigue, weakness, sensitivity to cold, decreased sexual interest, infertility</li>

        <h2>Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>The exact cause of pituitary tumors is not well understood. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic - they're not inherited and occur in people with no family history of pituitary problems.</p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Potential Causes</h3>
                <ul class="cause-list">
                    <li><strong>Genetic alterations</strong> - Certain gene mutations may cause abnormal cell growth in the pituitary gland</li>
                    <li><strong>Hereditary disorders</strong> - Rarely, pituitary tumors can be associated with genetic syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                <ul class="cause-list">
                    <li><strong>Family history</strong> of pituitary tumors or endocrine disorders</li>
                    <li><strong>Age</strong> - Most common in adults, though they can occur at any age</li>
                    <li><strong>Certain hereditary conditions</strong> like MEN 1, Carney complex, or familial isolated pituitary adenoma</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Diagnosing pituitary tumors typically involves several tests and procedures:</p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Physical Examination</h3>
                <p>Your doctor will look for signs and symptoms that might indicate a pituitary tumor or hormone abnormalities.</p>
                
                <h3>Blood and Urine Tests</h3>
                <p>These tests measure hormone levels to detect abnormal pituitary function, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Growth hormone levels</li>
                    <li>Prolactin levels</li>
                    <li>ACTH and cortisol levels</li>
                    <li>Thyroid hormone levels</li>
                    <li>Sex hormone levels (estrogen, testosterone)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Imaging Tests</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MRI</strong> - Primary imaging test for pituitary tumors, providing detailed images of the pituitary gland</li>
                    <img src="/Brain-Tumor-Detection-/BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM/IMAGES/mri pi(1).jpg">
                    <img src="/Brain-Tumor-Detection-/BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM/IMAGES/mri pi.jpg">
                    <li><strong>CT scan</strong> - May be used if MRI is not possible but mostly us in</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Vision Testing</h3>
                <p>Since pituitary tumors can press on the optic nerves, comprehensive vision testing may be performed to check for vision loss.</p>
                
                <h3>Additional Tests</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stimulation or suppression tests to evaluate hormone production</li>
                    <li>Growth hormone suppression test</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>Treatment depends on the tumor size, whether it's functional (hormone-producing), and your overall health. Options include:</p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <div class="card">
                <div class="treatment-options">
                    <h4>Wait and See (Observation)</h4>
                    <p>For small, non-functional tumors that aren't causing symptoms, regular monitoring may be recommended.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Medications</h4>
                    <p>Certain medications can reduce tumor size or normalize hormone production:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine) for prolactin-secreting tumors</li>
                        <li>Somatostatin analogs for growth hormone-secreting tumors</li>
                        <li>Hormone replacement therapy for underactive pituitary function</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <div class="treatment-options">
                    <h4>Surgery</h4>
                    <p>Transsphenoidal surgery (through the nose and sphenoid sinus) is the most common approach. For larger tumors, a craniotomy may be necessary.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Radiation Therapy</h4>
                    <p>May be used after surgery for residual tumor tissue or when surgery isn't possible:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stereotactic radiosurgery (focused radiation)</li>
                        <li>Conventional radiation therapy</li>
