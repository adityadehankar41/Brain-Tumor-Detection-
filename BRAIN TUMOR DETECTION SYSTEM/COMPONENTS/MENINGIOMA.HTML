            <h2>What is a Meningioma?</h2>
            <p>A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges â€” the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas are noncancerous (benign), though rarely some can be cancerous (malignant). Meningiomas grow slowly, often over many years without causing symptoms.</p>
            
            <p>These tumors are the most common type of tumor that forms in the head. Meningiomas occur most commonly in women and are often discovered at older ages, but they can occur at any age.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">

        </div>     
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Many meningiomas cause no noticeable symptoms and remain stable, requiring no immediate treatment. However, signs and symptoms may occur depending on where in the brain or, rarely, spine the tumor is situated.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Headaches that worsen with time</li>
                <li>Seizures</li>
                <li>Vision problems (blurry vision, double vision or vision loss)</li>
                <li>Hearing loss or ringing in the ears</li>
                <li>Memory problems</li>
                <li>Loss of smell</li>
                <li>Weakness in your arms or legs</li>
                <li>Language difficulty</li>
                <li>Personality changes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>When to see a doctor:</strong> Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent signs and symptoms that concern you, such as headaches that worsen over time, vision problems, hearing loss, or persistent weakness in your arms or legs.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of meningiomas is not known. Doctors know that something alters some cells in your meninges to make them multiply out of control, leading to a meningioma tumor.</p>
            
            <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
            <p>Several factors may increase your risk of developing a meningioma:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Radiation treatment:</strong> Radiation therapy that involves radiation to the head may increase the risk of a meningioma.</li>
                <li><strong>Female hormones:</strong> Meningiomas are more common in women, suggesting that female hormones may play a role. Some meningiomas contain receptors for hormones.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurofibromatosis type 2:</strong> This rare genetic disorder increases the risk of meningiomas and other brain tumors.</li>
                <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Being significantly overweight increases the risk of meningiomas.</li>
                <li><strong>Genomic changes:</strong> Specific genomic changes are associated with meningiomas.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Meningiomas are often found incidentally during imaging tests for other conditions. If you have symptoms that suggest a meningioma, your doctor may recommend several tests and procedures.</p>
            
            <h3>Neurological Exam</h3>
            <p>Your doctor may conduct a neurological exam to check your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Problems in one or more of these areas may provide clues about the part of your brain that could be affected by a meningioma.</p>
            
            <h3>Imaging Tests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MRI:</strong> This is the preferred imaging technique to evaluate meningiomas. Using a special dye (contrast medium) helps to highlight tumors.</li>
                <img src="/Brain-Tumor-Detection-/BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM/IMAGES/mri pi.jpg" >
                <li><strong>CT scan:</strong> This may be used if MRI isn't available or possible. CT scans use X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your brain and can help detect a meningioma.</li>
                <img src="/Brain-Tumor-Detection-/BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM/IMAGES/download.jpg" >
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Biopsy</h3>
            <p>In some cases, a biopsy sample may be taken to determine whether a tumor is cancerous. This involves surgically removing a small portion of the tumor tissue for laboratory analysis. This is typically done as part of surgery to remove the meningioma.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>The treatment plan for a meningioma depends on many factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Size and location of the meningioma</li>
                <li>Rate of growth or aggressiveness</li>
                <li>Your age and overall health</li>
                <li>Your preferences</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Observation (Active Monitoring)</h3>
            <p>If your meningioma is small and not causing signs or symptoms, your doctor may recommend monitoring it periodically with imaging studies rather than immediate intervention. Some meningiomas never require treatment.</p>
            
            <h3>Surgery</h3>
            <p>If treatment is necessary, surgery to remove the meningioma is often the first option. The goal is to remove the meningioma completely, including the tumor, its attachment to the dura mater (outer covering of the brain), and any abnormal bone.</p>
            <p>Complete removal may not be possible if the tumor is in a delicate area or extensively involves nearby structures. In these cases, surgeons remove as much as is safely possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
            <p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill tumor cells. It may be recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After surgery, to remove any remaining tumor cells</li>
                <li>For tumors that can't be removed completely with surgery</li>
                <li>For recurrent tumors</li>
                <li>For high-grade (aggressive) meningiomas</li>
                <li>As a primary treatment if surgery isn't possible</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Types of radiation therapy include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS):</strong> Delivers a focused, high dose of radiation precisely to the tumor</li>
                <li><strong>External beam radiation:</strong> Traditional form of radiation delivered over multiple sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Proton beam radiation:</strong> Uses protons rather than X-rays, which may reduce damage to surrounding tissues</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Medications</h3>
            <p>For aggressive or recurrent meningiomas, medications may be considered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Helps your immune system fight the tumor</li>
                <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Uses drugs to kill tumor cells, though it's less effective for meningiomas</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted drug therapy:</strong> Focuses on specific abnormalities within tumor cells</li>
                <li><strong>Hormone therapy:</strong> May help with tumors that have hormone receptors</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Clinical Trials</h3>
            
            <p>Ask your doctor about clinical trials that might be suitable for your situation. Clinical trials are studies of new or experimental treatments and provide access to cutting-edge therapies that aren't widely available.</p>
            
            <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
            <p>Supportive (palliative) care focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care.</p>

            <h2>Living With Meningioma</h2>
            <p>Living with a meningioma or recovering from treatment may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rehabilitation services:</strong> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, or other types of rehabilitation may be necessary</li>
                <li><strong>Regular follow-up imaging:</strong> To monitor for recurrence or growth</li>
                <li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Connecting with others who understand your experience</li>
                <li><strong>Learning about your condition:</strong> Understanding meningiomas can help you make informed decisions about your care</li>
