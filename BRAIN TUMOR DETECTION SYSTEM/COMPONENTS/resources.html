            <h2>About Brain Tumors</h2>
            <p>Brain tumors are masses or growths of abnormal cells in the brain. Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). Brain tumors can begin in the brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain as secondary (metastatic) brain tumors.</p>

                    <h3>Primary Brain Tumors</h3>
                    <p>These tumors originate in the brain itself or in tissues close to it, such as in the brain-covering membranes (meninges), cranial nerves, or the pituitary gland.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Secondary Brain Tumors</h3>
                    <p>Secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors, occur when cancer cells spread to the brain from another organ, such as the lung or breast.</p>

            <h2>Brain Tumor Detection Methods</h2>
            <p>Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment. Modern medical imaging technologies have significantly improved our ability to detect and diagnose brain tumors with precision.</p>

                        <p>The detection process often begins with a neurological examination, where a doctor will evaluate your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, and reflexes. This helps identify any areas of the brain that may be affected.</p>

                        <p>If a brain tumor is suspected, one or more imaging tests will be recommended:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):</strong> Creates detailed images of the brain using magnetic fields and radio waves.</li>
                            <li><strong>CT Scan (Computed Tomography):</strong> Uses X-rays to create detailed images of the brain from different angles.</li>
                            <li><strong>PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography):</strong> Shows metabolic activity in the brain, helping differentiate between tumor types.</li>

                    <p>Common warning signs include persistent headaches (especially those that are worse in the morning), unexplained nausea or vomiting, vision problems, gradual loss of sensation or movement in arms or legs, balance problems, speech difficulties, confusion in everyday matters, personality or behavior changes, seizures, and hearing problems.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Modern imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans are highly accurate in detecting brain tumors, with MRI generally providing more detailed images of brain tissue. However, definitive diagnosis usually requires tissue sampling (biopsy). AI-enhanced imaging is improving detection rates even further, especially for smaller tumors.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If you're experiencing persistent symptoms that could indicate a brain tumor, consult your primary care physician promptly. They can perform an initial evaluation and refer you to a neurologist if necessary. Don't delay seeking medical attention, as early detection is critical for successful treatment.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No, not all brain tumors are cancerous. Brain tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors grow slowly, rarely spread, and may not need immediate treatment if they're not causing symptoms. However, even benign tumors can cause serious problems if they press on sensitive areas of the brain.</p>
