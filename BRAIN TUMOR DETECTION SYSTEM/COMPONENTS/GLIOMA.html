            <h2>What is a Glioma?</h2>
            <p>A glioma is a type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord. Gliomas begin in the glial cells that surround and support nerve cells. These tumors can affect brain function and be life-threatening depending on their location and rate of growth.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Glioma symptoms vary based on the tumor's location and size. Some common signs and symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Headache, often worse in the morning or when lying down</li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                <li>Confusion or decline in brain function</li>
                <li>Memory loss</li>
                <li>Personality changes or irritability</li>
                <li>Difficulty with balance</li>
                <li>Urinary incontinence</li>
                <li>Vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision or loss of peripheral vision</li>
                <li>Speech difficulties</li>
                <li>Seizures, especially in people with no history of seizures</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>The exact causes of gliomas are unknown. Doctors know that something occurs to create mutations in the DNA of normal cells, causing them to grow and divide at increased rates.</p>
            
            <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Though gliomas can occur at any age, they are more common in adults between ages 45 and 65</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation exposure:</strong> People exposed to ionizing radiation have an increased risk</li>
                <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Small percentage of gliomas occur in people with a family history of the condition</li>
                <li><strong>Genetic syndromes:</strong> Rare genetic conditions like neurofibromatosis type 1, Turcot syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome increase risk</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>If your doctor suspects you have a glioma, you may undergo several tests and procedures to diagnose it:</p>
            
            <h3>Neurological Exam</h3>
            <p>Your doctor will check your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes to identify affected areas of your brain.</p>
            
            <h3>Imaging Tests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MRI:</strong> The primary tool used to identify brain tumors</li>
                <li><strong>CT scan:</strong> May be used when MRI isn't available or possible</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced imaging techniques:</strong> May include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)</li>
                        <li>Perfusion MRI</li>
                        <li>Functional MRI (fMRI)</li>
                        <li>Positron emission tomography (PET)</li>
                        <img src="/BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM/IMAGES/Glioma.jpg" >
                        <img src="/BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION SYSTEM/IMAGES/Glioma (1).jpg">
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Biopsy</h3>
            <p>The definitive way to diagnose a glioma is to remove a sample of tumor tissue for testing. This may be done during surgery to remove the glioma or as a separate procedure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stereotactic needle biopsy:</strong> Used when the tumor is in a hard-to-reach area or sensitive area that might be damaged by more extensive surgery</li>
                <li><strong>Surgical biopsy or tumor removal:</strong> When the tumor is in an accessible location</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Molecular Testing</h3>
            <p>Advanced laboratory tests examine tumor cells to look for specific genetic mutations that may provide additional diagnostic information and help determine optimal treatment approaches.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Treatment options depend on the type, size, grade, and location of the glioma, as well as your overall health and preferences.</p>
            
            <h3>Surgery</h3>
            <p>The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the tumor as safely possible. Complete removal may not be possible if the tumor is located in a sensitive area of your brain. Surgical options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Awake craniotomy:</strong> Performed while you're awake to monitor brain function</li>
                <li><strong>Intraoperative MRI:</strong> Using MRI during surgery to guide tumor removal</li>
                <li><strong>Computer-assisted surgery:</strong> Neuronavigation systems to guide the surgeon</li>
                <li><strong>Ultrasonic aspirators:</strong> Special surgical tools to break up and remove tumors</li>
                <li><strong>Fluorescence-guided surgery:</strong> Using special dyes to identify tumor tissue</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
            <p>High-energy beams such as X-rays or protons are used to kill tumor cells. Types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>External beam radiation:</strong> Standard approach delivering radiation from outside the body</li>
                <li><strong>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT):</strong> More precise targeting of tumor cells</li>
                <li><strong>3D conformal radiation therapy:</strong> Shapes radiation beams to match the tumor's shape</li>
                <li><strong>Proton therapy:</strong> Uses protons rather than X-rays</li>
                <li><strong>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS):</strong> Delivers high doses of radiation to a small area</li>
                <li><strong>Brachytherapy:</strong> Placing radioactive seeds within or near the tumor</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
            <p>Drugs that kill tumor cells, which may be taken orally or injected into a vein. Temozolomide (Temodar) is commonly used for gliomas.</p>
            
            <h3>Targeted Drug Therapy</h3>
            <p>Focuses on specific abnormalities in cancer cells. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bevacizumab (Avastin):</strong> Stops the formation of new blood vessels</li>
                <li>Drugs targeting specific gene mutations found in tumor cells</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) Therapy</h3>
            <p>Uses electrical fields to disrupt cell division, administered through adhesive patches connected to a portable device.</p>
            
            <h3>Rehabilitation</h3>
            <p>After treatment, you may need rehabilitation services including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical therapy</li>
                <li>Occupational therapy</li>
                <li>Speech therapy</li>
                <li>Tutoring for school-age children</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Clinical Trials</h3>
            <p>Consider participating in clinical trials testing new treatments, which might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New drug therapies</li>
                <li>New radiation therapies</li>
                <li>Gene therapies</li>
                <li>Immunotherapies</li>
                <li>Vaccines</li>
                <li>Combination treatments</li>
            </ul>
